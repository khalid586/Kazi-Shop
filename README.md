Kazi departmental store is a physical store located in cumilla. The customer base is mostly people living at jhautola.

**We were given a task by one of our supervisors that we have to build a product for an enterprise.**

**This project was a part of one of our sessional courses.We decided to build a website where customers can order a product and the admin can see the products ordered by customers.**

We decided to complete this project in django because:
  - Takes less time to build prototype.
  - Comes with SQLite as database.
  - Django comes with a default admin panel(which we later customized) which made our job easier.
